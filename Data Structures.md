### Data Structures

#### **Linear Data Structures**
1. **Array**
2. **Linked List**
   - Singly Linked List
   - Doubly Linked List
   - Circular Linked List
3. **Stack**
4. **Queue**
   - Simple Queue
   - Circular Queue
   - Priority Queue
   - Deque (Double-ended Queue)
5. **Hash Table** (When considering linear probing or similar strategies)
6. **Matrix**

#### **Non-Linear Data Structures**
1. **Tree**
   - Binary Tree
   - Binary Search Tree (BST)
   - AVL Tree
   - Red-Black Tree
   - B-Tree
   - B+ Tree
   - Heap (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
   - Trie
2. **Graph**
   - Directed Graph
   - Undirected Graph
   - Weighted Graph
   - Unweighted Graph
   - Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
3. **Hash Table** (When considering chaining as the collision resolution method)
4. **Set** (can also be considered non-linear in some implementations) 

These categorizations are based on how data is arranged and accessed within the structure. Linear structures involve data elements arranged in a sequential order, while non-linear structures involve hierarchical or interconnected elements.
